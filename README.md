# Week 5 Lab – Networking & Windows System Analysis  

This lab was part of my cybersecurity studies.  
It demonstrates practical skills in **network design** and **Windows system commands** that are directly useful for SOC and cybersecurity work.

## 🌐 Part B – IP Addressing Plan  

- Designed an IP addressing scheme for a small enterprise network (10.0.75.0/24).  
- Included segments for **Firewall, Router, DNS/DHCP, Proxy, Web Server, IoT, and Clients**.  
- Applied subnetting and assigned static IPs for critical devices.  

📌 **Why it matters for cybersecurity:**  
Understanding IP planning and segmentation is essential for:  
- Creating **secure zones (DMZ, IoT, Server segment)**  
- Limiting attack surfaces  
- Monitoring traffic in SOC environments

## 🖥 Part D – Windows Commands  

Worked with **Windows system commands (WMIC, systeminfo, netstat, etc.)** in SierraLab:  
- Gathered system info (OS version, hardware, uptime)  
- Enumerated running processes and network connections  
- Practiced commands for quick triage during incident analysis  

📌 **Why it matters for cybersecurity:**  
SOC analysts use such commands in real investigations to:  
- Detect suspicious processes  
- Collect evidence during incident response  
- Verify system integrity
